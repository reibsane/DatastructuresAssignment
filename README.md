Introduction

My project is a database designed for reloading, it will store a variety of information about different calibers, bullet weights, power types, etc. I plan on using this personally to keep track of which loads work well and which dont, as well as specifics about their performance

Use Case

User needs to load ammunition for their hunting rifle, they imput their caliber and avalible powders, bullets, etc. the database then displays a list of load data. each set of data includes information on the performance of that particular load (velocity, grouping, etc.). this allows the user to select the best load data for their intended use
